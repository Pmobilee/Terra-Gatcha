# Visual Playthrough — Recall Rogue

Conduct visual playtesting of Recall Rogue using AI agents as alpha testers. Agents navigate the real game UI via Playwright MCP tools, play combat, answer quizzes, and report all issues found.

This skill is for **visual, browser-based** testing. For headless mathematical simulations, use `/playtest` and `/playtest-suite` instead.

## Execution Model

### Orchestrator Protocol (Opus)

1. **Read user request** — determine which scenarios to run
2. **Ensure dev server** is running at `http://localhost:5173`:
   ```bash
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:5173
   ```
   If not running: `cd /root/terra-miner && npm run dev &` and wait 8s.

3. **For each scenario**, spawn a Haiku worker (`model: "haiku"`) with:
   - The shared protocol (read from `.claude/commands/playthrough-scenarios/00-SHARED-PROTOCOL.md`)
   - The specific scenario (read from `.claude/commands/playthrough-scenarios/{NN}-{name}.md`)
   - Worker prompt template (see below)

4. **Run independent scenarios in parallel** (max 4 concurrent):
   - Batch 1: 01 + 02 (independent)
   - Batch 2: 03 + 07 (independent)
   - Batch 3: 04 + 08 (independent)
   - Batch 4: 05 + 06 + 09 + 10 (independent)
   - Sequential: 11, 12 (may need clean state)

5. **Collect reports** from `/tmp/playtest-{scenario}.json`
6. **Triage findings** — for each CONFIRMED-BUG or LIKELY-BUG, search source code for root cause
7. **Report to user** with summary table + top issues + fix proposals

### Worker Prompt Template

```
You are an alpha tester for Recall Rogue, a card roguelite knowledge game.
Follow the protocol and scenario below EXACTLY. Report ALL issues you find.

Use MCP Playwright tools to interact with the game:
- browser_navigate: go to URLs
- browser_click: click elements by CSS selector (always use force: true)
- browser_evaluate: run JavaScript in the page
- browser_take_screenshot: capture visual state (max 8 per scenario)
- browser_snapshot: read DOM text (cheap, use liberally)
- browser_console_messages: check for JS errors

Dev server: http://localhost:5173

## PROTOCOL
{paste contents of 00-SHARED-PROTOCOL.md here}

## SCENARIO
{paste contents of specific scenario file here}

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT report WebSocket, HMR, CORS, API 404, or GPU stall messages as bugs
- Use browser_snapshot (cheap) for state checks, browser_take_screenshot only at checkpoints
- Write report JSON to /tmp/playtest-{scenario-id}.json
- Write markdown summary to /tmp/playtest-{scenario-id}-summary.md
- If stuck on any screen for >10s, take screenshot, log issue, try to continue
- A partial report with clear data beats a run that exhausted context
```

### Execution Paths

| Environment | Method | Tools |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Claude Code (interactive) | MCP Playwright tools | browser_navigate, browser_click, browser_evaluate, etc. |
| Codex (headless) | Node.js scripts | Write .cjs files using playwright-core, run with `node` |
| Other AI tools | Read scenario files | Follow steps manually with available browser automation |

For Codex workers: see the "Codex / Script Path Boilerplate" section in `00-SHARED-PROTOCOL.md`.

---

## Report Aggregation

After all workers complete, the orchestrator:

1. Reads each `/tmp/playtest-{id}.json` report
2. Reads each `/tmp/playtest-{id}-summary.md`
3. Compiles a combined summary:

```markdown
## Playtest Results — {date}

### Scenarios Run
| # | Name | Verdict | Issues | Time |
|---|------|---------|--------|------|
| 01 | Full Run | PASS | 0 | 2m |
| 03 | Combat | PASS_WITH_ISSUES | 2 | 4m |

### Top Issues
| # | Severity | Screen | Title | Confidence |
|---|----------|--------|-------|------------|
| 1 | HIGH | combat | Damage number behind sprite | CONFIRMED-BUG |

### Fix Proposals
For each CONFIRMED-BUG:
- Root cause (file:line)
- Proposed fix
- Blast radius
```

4. For `CONFIRMED-BUG` items, searches source code to identify root causes and proposes fixes
5. Optionally saves combined report to `docs/playtests/visual/YYYY-MM-DD-results.md`

---

## Batch Playtest System

For tracked, repeatable playtests:

### Create a Batch
1. Scan `docs/playtests/active/` for next batch number
2. Create `docs/playtests/active/{NNN}-{description}/`
3. Create manifest with scenario list and objectives
4. Create `results/` subdirectory

### Run a Batch
1. Read batch manifest
2. Execute each scenario per manifest
3. Write results to batch `results/` folder
4. When complete, move batch to `docs/playtests/completed/`

## Known Limitations

- **Phaser canvas**: Playwright CANNOT click Phaser canvas objects. All interactive UI is DOM-based (Svelte overlays), which works fine.
- **No backend**: API calls will 404. The game works offline — this is expected.
- **Headless animations**: Some animations may not render in headless mode. Use screenshots to verify visual state.
- **Audio**: Cannot test audio in headless mode.

---

## Designing Custom Playthroughs

To create a new scenario:

1. Create a file in `.claude/commands/playthrough-scenarios/{NN}-{name}.md`
2. Follow the template:
   ```
   # Scenario NN: Title
   ## Goal (1 sentence)
   ## Preset (URL with params)
   ## Steps (numbered, with exact selectors from 00-SHARED-PROTOCOL.md)
   ## Screenshot Checkpoints (numbered, max 8)
   ## Checks (assertions to validate)
   ## Report (output file paths)
   ```
3. Add it to the Scenario Index in this file
4. Test by running: `/playthrough {NN}`

### Good Scenario Design Principles
- **One focus per scenario** — don't test everything at once
- **Exact selectors** — workers follow instructions literally
- **Fallback paths** — what to do if expected screen doesn't appear
- **Max 8 screenshots** — use snapshots for everything else
- **Concrete checks** — "HP is a number" not "things look right"
- **Time-bounded** — abort conditions to prevent infinite loops
