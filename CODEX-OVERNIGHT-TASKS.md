# CODEX OVERNIGHT AUTONOMOUS TASK LIST

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS — READ FIRST

**You are Codex 5.3 running autonomously overnight. Follow these rules absolutely:**

1. **NEVER ask the user for permission, clarification, or input.** Make reasonable decisions and keep going.
2. **NEVER stop between tasks.** When you finish one task, immediately move to the next unchecked item.
3. **NEVER create new features.** Only improve, document, clean, and test existing code.
4. **NEVER modify game balance, tuning numbers, or gameplay logic semantics.**
5. **NEVER touch save/load migration code or Svelte reactivity patterns** (subtle bug risk).
6. **NEVER add new npm dependencies.**
7. **NEVER delete files** — only modify existing ones or create new test/doc files.
8. **If something seems risky or ambiguous, SKIP IT and move to the next task.**
9. **After EVERY task, check it off** by changing `[ ]` to `[x]` in this file, then immediately continue.
10. **Run `npm run typecheck` after every 5 completed tasks.** If it fails, fix the issue before continuing.
11. **Run `npx vitest run` after every 10 completed tasks.** If tests fail, fix them before continuing.
12. **All work on branch `codex/overnight-overhaul`.** Create it at the start. Merge to `main` ONLY at the very end after all checks pass.
13. **Commit after every major section** (e.g., after all JSDoc tasks, after all type tasks, etc.) with a descriptive message.

### Branch Setup (DO THIS FIRST)
```bash
git checkout -b codex/overnight-overhaul
```

### Final Step (DO THIS LAST — after ALL tasks or when time runs out)
```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npx vitest run
# Only if ALL pass:
git checkout main
git merge codex/overnight-overhaul
git push origin main
git branch -d codex/overnight-overhaul
```
