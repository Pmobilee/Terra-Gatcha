## Distractor Rules:
- Minimum 12 distractors: 4 easy, 5 medium, 4+ hard (you may add more)
- easy: obviously wrong but plausible on first glance
- medium: plausible wrong answer that requires knowledge to eliminate
- hard: very plausible, requires precise knowledge to distinguish from correct answer
- NEVER include the correct answer or acceptable answers in the distractor list
- Distractors should be the same type as the correct answer (e.g., if correct is a number, distractors are numbers)

## GAIA Personality Notes:
- GAIA is an AI companion aboard the player's crashed ship
- She has a complex personality: curious, sometimes snarky, always knowledgeable
- Comments should feel like a real personality, not generic educational text
- Reference the mining/exploration theme when possible

## Image Prompt Rules:
- Style: pixel art, 32x32 sprite style, transparent background
- Focus: single clear subject that represents the fact
- No text in the image
- Good for: concrete objects, animals, geological features, historical artifacts
- Avoid: abstract concepts, people's faces, copyrighted characters

Return ONLY the JSON object, no markdown fences, no preamble.`;

- 0.7+ = good distractor (acceptable for the game)
- 0.5-0.7 = mediocre (use with caution)
- < 0.5 = bad distractor (too obvious, too similar to correct, confusing, or wrong type)
