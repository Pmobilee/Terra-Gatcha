# Knowledge System — Terra Miner

The heart of the game: artifacts, facts, spaced repetition, and the Knowledge Tree.

## Design Goal

Make learning **genuinely addictive**. Players should find themselves wanting to learn more — not because the game forces them, but because the systems reward curiosity naturally. Facts must be fascinating, never boring. The quiz system must feel like a game mechanic, not a homework assignment.

## Artifacts

### What They Are
Artifacts are physical objects found while mining. They are compressed fragments of Earth's lost knowledge — data crystals, ancient tablets, encoded relics. Each artifact contains one or more **facts** about the real world.

### Discovery Flow
1. Player mines an **artifact node** in the mine
2. Artifact appears with **rarity visible** and a **category hint** (e.g., "Ancient Biology Artifact — Rare")
3. Artifact is **not yet readable** — its contents are unknown
4. Artifact takes up **backpack space** (Tetris-style shape, size varies by rarity)
5. Player must decide: carry it back (takes space away from minerals) or leave it

### Rarity Tiers
Rarity applies to the **artifact container**, not the fact itself. Facts are not inherently rare — they are knowledge that belongs to everyone. But the *artifact* that delivers the fact has a rarity tier, which correlates with how interesting/memorable the contained fact is.

| Tier | Color | Fact Quality | Drop Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Common | White/Grey | Solid foundational facts | ~60% |
| Uncommon | Green | Interesting, surprising facts | ~25% |
| Rare | Blue | Mind-blowing, highly memorable | ~10% |
| Epic | Purple | Extraordinary, paradigm-shifting | ~4% |
| Legendary | Gold | The most fascinating facts known | ~0.9% |
| Mythic | Rainbow/Prismatic | Unique, one-of-a-kind revelations | ~0.1% |

**Key design rule**: Artifact rarity correlates with how *interesting and memorable* the contained fact is, not how "important" or "difficult" it is.
- Common artifact: "Copper has been used by humans for over 10,000 years" (useful, solid)
- Legendary artifact: "Octopuses have three hearts and blue blood" (mind-blowing, unforgettable)

### Gacha Moments
Artifact ingestion is one of **multiple gacha moments** in the game. The full set:
1. **Artifact reveal** at base (most frequent) — crack open an artifact, see the fact and its quality
2. **Dive reward chest** — end-of-run bonus loot based on performance
3. **Pet synthesis** — revive a fossil into a living creature (biggest spectacle)

Each gacha moment should have **escalating visual and audio spectacle by rarity**:
- Common: quick shimmer, subtle chime
- Rare: particle burst, satisfying sound
- Epic: screen flash, dramatic reveal
- Legendary: full-screen lightshow, fanfare
- Mythic: unique animation, unforgettable moment

### At Base: Ingestion
- Back at the dome, player feeds artifacts into the **Miner's Computer** (codex)
- The fact is revealed with a gacha-tier animation (see above)
- Player then chooses:
  - **Keep for study rotation**: Fact enters the Anki-style review system
  - **Sell for minerals**: Convert the fact to currency (higher rarity = more minerals)
  - **Mark as "already known"**: Skip the learning phase, but the system will quiz you on it periodically — you must prove you actually know it by getting it right several times
- Some artifacts can be **scanned mid-dive** (rare ability, requires scanner upgrade), immediately adding to codex without using backpack space

### Duplicate & Unwanted Facts
- If a player finds a fact they already have, or marks a fact as uninteresting:
  - **Trade** with other players (future multiplayer feature)
  - **Mix duplicates/unwanted facts** at the Materializer: combine several to reroll into a new artifact of potentially higher rarity (gacha recycling!)
  - Auto-convert to minerals if the player just wants currency
- Players can flag facts as "not interesting" — this feeds back into our content quality metrics

### Backpack Trade-Off
This is a critical tension point: **artifacts compete with minerals for backpack space**.
- Minerals = currency for upgrades, crafting, base building
- Artifacts = knowledge, long-term progression, Knowledge Tree growth
- A higher-rarity artifact is larger in the backpack, amplifying the decision
- Players must constantly weigh short-term (minerals) vs. long-term (knowledge)

## Facts

### Content Philosophy
Facts must be **ultra-interesting**. The bar is high:
- **YES**: "Astronauts on the ISS aren't floating — they're falling at the same rate as the station"
- **YES**: "Cleopatra lived closer in time to the Moon landing than to the construction of the Great Pyramid"
- **NO**: "The Battle of Hastings was in 1066" (dry dates without context)
- **NO**: "The chemical symbol for Sodium is Na" (rote memorization without wonder)

Every fact should make the player think "wait, really?!" or "I need to tell someone this."

### Fact Structure
Each fact in the database contains:
```
{
  id: string,
  statement: string,           // The core fact (1-2 sentences)
  explanation: string,         // Why it's true / deeper context (2-3 sentences)
  quiz_question: string,       // The question asked during review
  correct_answer: string,      // The right answer
  distractors: string[25],    // ~25 plausible wrong answers (similar domain)
  category: string[],          // Hierarchical: ["Science", "Biology", "Evolution"]
  rarity: Rarity,             // Determines which artifact tier contains this
  difficulty: number,          // 1-5, affects distractor similarity
  fun_score: number,          // 1-10, editorial rating of interestingness
  novelty_score: number,      // 1-10, how surprising is this to most people
  source_url: string,         // Where we verified this fact
  source_name: string,        // Human-readable source
  tags: string[],             // For cross-referencing and gap analysis
  related_facts: string[],    // IDs of related facts for "deep dive" chains
}
```

**Why 25 distractors?** Each quiz shows 1 correct + 3 randomly selected distractors from the pool of ~25. This prevents players from memorizing the wrong answers by process of elimination. With 25 distractors, a fact can be quizzed hundreds of times before the player sees the same set of 3 wrong answers. This is critical for the spaced repetition system — players must actually *know* the answer, not just recognize which wrong answers they've seen before.

### Fact Categories (Wikipedia-Inspired Structure)
Top-level branches (expandable over time):
- **Natural Sciences**: Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Earth Science, Astronomy
- **Life Sciences**: Evolution, Ecology, Human Body, Animals, Plants
- **History**: Ancient, Medieval, Modern, Contemporary, Prehistoric
- **Geography**: Countries, Oceans, Mountains, Climate, Geology
- **Technology**: Inventions, Computing, Engineering, Space Exploration
- **Culture**: Art, Music, Literature, Philosophy, Mythology
- **Language** (future): Vocabulary, Grammar, Etymology, Phrases

Each branch subdivides further, following Wikipedia's category structure as a guide.

### Fact Quality Pipeline
1. **Ingestion**: Extract candidate facts from curated sources (Wikipedia, science journals, educational content)
2. **Scoring**: Rate each fact on fun, novelty, accuracy, and learnability
3. **Distractor Generation**: Create ~25 plausible wrong answers per fact (critical — see why above)
4. **Categorization**: Place in the knowledge hierarchy
5. **Review**: Human editorial pass for quality, accuracy, and interestingness
6. **Storage**: Qdrant/Graphiti vector database for semantic search, gap analysis, and duplicate detection
7. **Gap Analysis**: Identify which categories are under-represented and need more content
8. **Player Feedback Loop**: Facts flagged as "not interesting" by players are reviewed and potentially replaced

### Content Scale
- **Phase 1 (Testing)**: ~500 high-quality facts across all categories
- **Phase 2 (Launch)**: ~5,000 facts
- **Phase 3 (Growth)**: 10,000+ facts
- **Long-term**: Language learning integration (vocabulary, phrases, grammar as "facts")

### Data Discs (Deep Dive Content)
- Special collectible found during dives (rarer than standard artifacts)
- Contains an **expanded pack** of facts around a specific topic
- e.g., "Data Disc: The Solar System" contains 10-20 detailed facts about planets, moons, orbits
- Can also be purchased in a shop to expand a category the player is interested in

## Quiz System

### When Quizzes Happen

| Context | Trigger | Stakes |
|---|---|---|
| **Quiz Gates** (during dive) | Barrier blocks in the mine | Wrong answer costs oxygen. Correct = proceed. Max 2 failures before forced bypass with penalty. |
| **Artifact Mining** (during dive) | Mining an artifact node | Number of correct answers (with max 2 failures) determines reward rarity boost |
| **Morning/Evening Review** (at base) | Daily login ritual | Bonus oxygen for completing reviews |
| **Pop-up Reviews** (at base) | Random prompts, couple per day | Small oxygen bonus |
| **Study Session** (at base) | Voluntary, player-initiated | Knowledge Tree growth, mastery progress |
| **Random Mining Quiz** (during dive) | Occasionally when mining any block | Small reward for correct, no penalty for wrong |

### Quiz Format
- **Multiple choice**: 1 correct answer + 3 distractors (randomly selected from the fact's pool of ~25)
- Distractors are from the **same domain** as the correct answer (e.g., if the answer is "Jupiter," distractors are other planets — not random words)
- **Different 3 distractors each time** the fact is quizzed — prevents memorizing wrong answers
- Difficulty of distractors scales with:
  - The fact's inherent difficulty rating
  - The depth layer where the quiz appears (deeper = harder)
  - The player's mastery level of this fact (Anki interval)
- **No time pressure on quizzes** — this is a learning game, not a speed test. Players should think carefully.

### Quiz Gate Flow (During Dive)
1. Player encounters a quiz gate block
2. Question appears (from due-for-review facts, or new facts if none due)
3. Player answers
4. **Correct**: Gate opens, proceed. Small oxygen bonus possible.
5. **Wrong (1st failure)**: Oxygen penalty. Can try again with a different question.
6. **Wrong (2nd failure)**: Gate opens with larger oxygen penalty. Forced through.
7. Maximum 2 failures per gate — never hard-block progress

### Artifact Quiz Flow (During Dive)
1. Player mines an artifact node
2. Quick quiz sequence (2-3 questions)
3. Each correct answer improves the chance of a **rarity upgrade** on the artifact
4. Max 2 failures allowed
5. Result: artifact with potentially boosted rarity enters backpack

## Spaced Repetition (Anki-Style)

### Algorithm: SM-2 Variant
Based on the SuperMemo SM-2 algorithm, the gold standard for spaced repetition:

**Core variables per fact (hidden from player):**
- `ease_factor`: Starts at 2.5. Adjusted by response quality.
- `interval`: Days until next review. Starts at 1 day.
- `repetitions`: Number of consecutive correct reviews.
- `quality`: Last response quality (0-5 scale internally, mapped from player input).

**After each review:**
- **Correct (quality >= 3)**: Increase interval by `interval * ease_factor`. Increment repetitions.
- **Wrong (quality < 3)**: Reset interval to 1 day. Reset repetitions to 0. Decrease ease_factor (minimum 1.3).
- Ease factor adjusts: `ease_factor + (0.1 - (5 - quality) * (0.08 + (5 - quality) * 0.02))`

**Player-facing interface**: Simple right/wrong, possibly with a "that was easy" / "that was hard" modifier. The algorithm complexity is entirely hidden.

### Mastery Levels
As a fact's interval grows (meaning the player keeps getting it right over longer periods), it progresses through mastery levels:

| Level | Interval | Visual | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| New | 0 days | Seed | Just discovered |
| Learning | 1-3 days | Sprout | Actively being learned |
| Familiar | 4-14 days | Young leaf | Getting comfortable |
| Known | 15-60 days | Full leaf | Solidly learned |
| Mastered | 60+ days | Golden leaf | Deeply retained |

### Leaf Decay
- If a player gets a fact **wrong** during review, the leaf on the Knowledge Tree **wilts** (visual feedback)
- The fact re-enters active rotation with a shortened interval
- Leaves can regrow easily — this is not punishing, just visual feedback
- Mastered facts that haven't been reviewed in a very long time may show slight color changes as a gentle reminder

## Knowledge Tree

### Concept
A visual, growing tree at the center of the player's dome (base). It represents everything they've learned. Each **leaf** is a mastered fact. **Branches** are categories and subcategories. The tree grows as the player learns, creating a beautiful, personalized visualization of their knowledge.

### Structure
```
Knowledge Tree (trunk)
├── Natural Sciences (major branch)
│   ├── Physics (branch)
│   │   ├── "Light takes 8 minutes to reach Earth" (leaf - mastered, golden)
│   │   ├── "Gravity on Moon is 1/6th of Earth" (leaf - known, green)
│   │   └── "Sound can't travel in vacuum" (leaf - learning, sprout)
│   ├── Biology (branch)
│   │   ├── Evolution (sub-branch)
│   │   │   ├── "Birds descended from dinosaurs" (leaf)
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
├── History (major branch)
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

### Visual Properties
- **Leaf color** reflects mastery level (see table above)
- **Leaf size** may reflect fact rarity/importance
- **Wilting leaves** = facts that need review (gentle visual nudge)
- **Branch thickness** grows as more facts are mastered in that category
- **Completion percentage** shown per branch ("Biology: 34% explored")
- Tree should be **beautiful and shareable** — a point of pride

### Gameplay Integration
- Primarily **cosmetic and social** — a trophy of learning
- Can be **shared** with other players (visit each other's domes)
- **Completion percentages** drive completionists
- **Future potential**: Unlocking branch bonuses (e.g., completing Geology gives mining bonuses). Deferred for now to keep focus on intrinsic learning motivation.
- Fully learned facts are never lost — the Knowledge Tree is **permanent progression**

### Knowledge Store (Planned)
- After learning a specific number of facts in a category, unlock purchases in the Knowledge Store
- Small powerups, cosmetics, decorations tied to the knowledge category
- Creates a mechanical reward for sustained learning without making it feel forced
- Currency: earned through learning milestones, not bought

## Fact Selling vs. Keeping: The Core Trade-Off

Why would a player keep a fact instead of selling it for minerals?

**Reasons to sell:**
- Immediate mineral income for crafting/upgrades
- Higher rarity = more minerals (tempting!)
- Already have too many facts in active rotation

**Reasons to keep:**
- Knowledge Tree growth (permanent, visible, shareable)
- Potential passive bonuses from branch completion (future)
- Knowledge Store unlocks from learning milestones
- Intrinsic satisfaction of growing knowledge
- Better quiz performance = more oxygen = more play time (mastery loop)
- Players who learn well can play indefinitely for free

**Design intent**: Both choices should feel valid. Selling should never feel wasteful, and keeping should never feel like a grind. The balance will need careful tuning.
