# Recall Rogue — Implementation Roadmap

> Design source of truth: `docs/GAME_DESIGN.md`
> Card roguelite spec: `docs/RESEARCH/02_terra-miner-card-roguelite-spec.md`

---

## Current Status

**Playable pre-launch build.** AR-01 through AR-16 core gameplay/content infrastructure is complete. AR-22 through AR-26 game design overhaul is complete (rename to Recall Rogue, 24-floor run structure, balance/UX pass, push notifications, doc overhaul).

**Recent completed phases (March 9, 2026):**
- AR-22 Global rename from "Arcane Recall" to "Recall Rogue" across all files.
- AR-23 Run structure overhauled to 24-floor dungeon with 4 segments, 8 bosses, 6 mini-boss templates, save/resume, campfire pause, special events.
- AR-24 Launch balance and UX pass: mechanic phase gating, difficulty mode rename, Story Mode forced runs 1-3, tier display simplification, wowFactor, review prompts.
- AR-25 Push notifications: 4 notification types, quiet hours, priority scheduling, per-type settings toggles.
- AR-26 All documentation updated to reflect AR-22-25 changes plus ascension mode design.

**Next up:** Complete AR-17 through AR-19 productionization (schema alignment, generation QA, and final migration flow). Remaining AR-11 content-regeneration cleanup is deferred until generation quality tuning is finalized.

**Parallel workstreams (separate from core engineering):**
- Visual descriptions regeneration (AR-11 Part C + AR-18 visual theming) is handled in a dedicated content-art stream.
- ComfyUI image/cardback generation is handled in a dedicated art pipeline stream.
- Core engineering continues independently on data pipelines, validation, gameplay logic, and DB migration tooling.

## In Progress

### AR-07: Launch Readiness (2/6 done — being superseded by AR-13)

- [ ] ~~Capacitor build verification~~ → moved to AR-13
- [x] **Accessibility baseline** — Colorblind support, 3 text sizes, high contrast, reduce motion, 48dp+ touch targets.
- [ ] ~~Playwright E2E test suite~~ → expanded in AR-13
- [ ] ~~Performance audit~~ → moved to AR-13
- [x] ~~Dead code cleanup~~ → completed in AR-13
- [x] **App store metadata** — Screenshots, description, privacy policy, age rating.

Note: AR-07 is being superseded by AR-13 which has a broader scope including web deployment, PWA, and the new deck building/hub features that must be tested. The completed items (accessibility, metadata) stand.

→ [Spec](phases/AR-07-LAUNCH-READINESS.md)

---

## Next Phases (Pre-Launch)

### AR-08: Hub Navigation & Feature Discovery
**Surface all built-but-hidden features.** Create main hub/home screen with navigation to Start Run, Knowledge Library, Settings, Profile. Add streak display, last run summary widget, post-run share image generator. Wire up existing components that currently have no entry point.

- [x] Main hub screen with tab/nav bar
- [x] Knowledge Library accessible from hub
- [x] Settings + Parental Controls accessible
- [x] Profile screen accessible
- [x] Streak display on home screen

- [x] Run start flow preserved (domain selection → archetype → run)

Depends on: None. Estimated: Medium. **Status: Completed (March 9, 2026).**
→ [Spec](completed/AR-08-HUB-NAVIGATION.md)

---

### AR-09: Strategic Deck Building (Card Type Selection)
**Replace random card rewards with type-selection for strategic deck building.** Players choose card TYPE after encounters (Attack/Shield/Heal/etc.), random fact assigned. Starter deck reduced to 15. Archetype selection at run start weights type options.

- [x] Card reward screen redesign: 3 TYPE options instead of 3 random cards
- [x] Type-to-fact random assignment on selection
- [x] Starter deck reduced from 20 to 15 cards
- [x] Archetype selection UI at run start (Balanced/Aggressive/Defensive/Control/Hybrid)
- [x] Archetype weighting logic for reward type options
- [x] Card selling/removal at shop rooms
- [x] Balance pass: starter deck composition, type distribution

Depends on: None. Estimated: Medium. **Status: Completed (March 9, 2026).**
→ [Spec](completed/AR-09-STRATEGIC-DECK-BUILDING.md)

---

### AR-10: Calibration & Cold Start Resolution
**Implement accelerated FSRS gains during early runs (Option B).** Finishes the last item from AR-04.

- [x] Early run boost: correct + fast (under 50% timer) = 2x stability gain during runs 1-3
- [x] Run accuracy bonus: 80%+ = flat +2d stability to all correct facts
- [x] First-time correct starts at 2d stability instead of 1d
- [x] Domain-specific acceleration on first selection of new domain
- [x] RunPoolBuilder probe mode: diverse-difficulty front-loading in first run per domain
- [x] Runs-per-domain tracking in player profile

Depends on: AR-02 (done). Estimated: Small-Medium. **Status: Completed (March 9, 2026).**
→ [Spec](completed/AR-10-CALIBRATION-COLD-START.md)

---

### AR-11: Content Pipeline Infrastructure (Claude CLI + Ingestion + Visual Descriptions)
**Build the full content production pipeline: Claude CLI fact generation → validation → ingestion → language-themed visual description generation → card back art.** This is the engine that scales from 122 facts to 10K+ per domain.

**Part A: Claude CLI Fact Generation Setup**
- [x] System prompts for fact generation per domain (Science, History, Geography, etc.)
- [x] System prompts for vocabulary generation per language (Japanese, Spanish, French, etc.)
- [x] Source citation requirement: every fact MUST have a `sourceName` (Wikipedia preferred)
- [x] Fact-checking validation tooling: cross-reference generated facts against source (`qa/source-fact-check.mjs`)
- [x] Output format: JSON matching seed data schema (all columns populated)
- [x] Distractor generation: 5+ plausible distractors per fact, close enough to challenge
- [x] Question variant generation: 3-4 variants per fact (forward, reverse, fill-blank, true/false)

**Part B: Ingestion & Validation**
- [x] CLI tool for bulk fact ingestion from JSON
- [x] Schema validation (all required fields, variant count ≥ 2, distractor count ≥ 2)
- [x] Duplicate detection (fuzzy match on question text)
- [x] Domain coverage report (facts per domain, per difficulty, age rating distribution)
- [x] Distractor quality flagging (too easy / too similar to correct answer)
- [x] Migration to sql.js database (public/facts.db + seed-pack.json)
- [x] `verifiedAt` workflow: unverified → verified via CLI command

**Part C: Language-Themed Visual Description Generation**
- [ ] Delete ALL existing vocab card visual descriptions (current ones are generic/bad)
- [x] New visual description system prompts PER LANGUAGE with cultural theming rules
- [x] Japanese: feudal Japan, torii gates, zen gardens, ukiyo-e palette, cherry blossoms
- [x] Spanish: Mediterranean/Latin American, terracotta, flamenco, warm sunset tones
- [x] French: Belle Époque, cobblestone cafés, lavender fields, romantic lighting
- [ ] (Additional languages follow same pattern — see GAME_DESIGN.md §22)
- [x] Anti-pattern detection: reject generic fantasy scenes with no cultural identity
- [x] Integration with existing `generate-visual-descriptions.mjs` pipeline
- [ ] Regenerate all 400 Japanese N3 vocab visual descriptions with Japan-themed prompts

**Part D: Documentation**
- [x] Document full pipeline so it can be run independently via Claude CLI
- [x] Example commands for each step (generate → validate → ingest → visual descriptions)
- [x] Quality checklist for reviewing generated content before approval

Depends on: None. Estimated: Large. **Can run in parallel with AR-08/09/10. CRITICAL PATH for content scaling.**
Implementation note: visual-description cleanup/regeneration tasks are tracked in a separate art/content workstream and intentionally not blocked by core pipeline engineering.
→ [Spec](phases/AR-11-CONTENT-PIPELINE.md)

---

### AR-12: Anonymous Auth & Cloud Save
**Enable progress persistence across devices.** Anonymous device ID on first launch, optional account creation to claim profile, cloud save via Fastify backend.

- [x] Conflict resolution: prefer higher-progress state
- [x] Guest-to-account migration
- [x] Login UI in Settings (minimal, non-blocking)
- [x] Auto-sync on run completion, graceful offline fallback

Depends on: AR-08 (Settings accessible). Estimated: Medium-Large. **Status: Completed (March 9, 2026).**
→ [Spec](completed/AR-12-AUTH-CLOUD-SAVE.md)

---

### AR-13: Launch Readiness (supersedes AR-07)
**Everything needed for Malaysia soft launch (web-first, Capacitor native later).**

- [x] Performance audit: 60fps combat, <3s cold start, <150MB memory
- [x] Full Playwright E2E test suite (hub, run flow, type selection, FSRS, combos, relics, save/load)
- [x] Dead code cleanup (archive mining-era code removed, no active social nav dead entries)
- [x] PWA configuration (manifest, service worker, offline, app icons)
- [x] Error tracking (Sentry or equivalent)
- [x] Share image generator verification
- [x] Responsive layout on common mobile screen sizes

Verification notes (March 10, 2026): `npm run typecheck` passes, `npm run build` succeeds, `npm test` passes (23/23 files). Dead-code cleanup completed by deleting `src/_archived-mining/` with no dangling imports.

Depends on: AR-08, AR-09. Estimated: Medium. **Status: Completed (March 10, 2026).**
→ [Spec](completed/AR-13-LAUNCH-READINESS.md)

---

### AR-14: Soft Launch & Analytics (Completed)
**Ship to limited market, measure everything, iterate.**

- [x] Instrument 10+ critical funnels (onboarding, runs, answers, domains, cash-out, deaths, tiers, bounties, streaks, shares)
- [x] A/B test experiments: Slow Reader default, 3 vs 4 AP, starter deck 15 vs 18
- [x] Malaysia geo-targeting or invite codes
- [x] In-app feedback button in Settings
- [x] Weekly analytics dashboard
- [x] Weekly analytics review checklist documented

Weekly runbook: `docs/roadmap/AR-14-WEEKLY-ANALYTICS-RUNBOOK.md`

Depends on: AR-12 (cloud save), AR-13 (deployed build). Estimated: Medium. **Status: Completed (March 9, 2026).**
→ [Spec](completed/AR-14-SOFT-LAUNCH-ANALYTICS.md)

---

### HOTFIX: Combat Improvements (Fact-Card Shuffling + Cooldown + Variants)
**Playtesting-driven fixes to card draw, fact repetition, and question variety.**

- [x] Fact-card shuffling: decouple facts from card slots, pair randomly each draw
- [x] Encounter cooldown: 3-encounter cooldown on answered facts
- [x] Variant expansion: knowledge facts minimum 4 variants (forward/reverse/negative/context/fill-blank/true-false)
- [x] Distractor quality validation hooks: pipeline flags answer/distractor collisions and risky wording (`qa/flag-content-risks.mjs`)
- [x] Vocab cards exempted from variant expansion (existing system preserved)

Priority: IMMEDIATE. Does not depend on any other phase. **Status: Completed (March 10, 2026).** See `docs/roadmap/AGENT-PROMPT-COMBAT-IMPROVEMENTS.md`.

---

## Post-Soft-Launch: Content at Scale

### AR-15: Content Source Registry & Wikidata Query Library (Completed)

Depends on: None. Estimated: Medium. **Status: Completed (March 9, 2026).**
→ [Spec](completed/AR-15-CONTENT-SOURCE-REGISTRY.md)

---

### AR-16: Knowledge Domain Expansion (Code Changes) (Completed)
**Add 6 new knowledge domains to the game codebase.** This is pure code — no content generation, no API keys.

- [x] Add new `FactDomain` values: `space_astronomy`, `mythology_folklore`, `animals_wildlife`, `human_body_health`, `food_cuisine`, `art_architecture`
- [x] Update `CATEGORIES` constant in `src/data/types.ts` to include all 10 knowledge domains + language

- [x] Add domain icon mapping support for new categories
- [x] Update age/content domain mapping compatibility
- [x] Flags/maps/country-heavy source handling documented as advisory-threshold content in the source pipeline

Depends on: None. Estimated: Medium. **Status: Completed (March 9, 2026).**
→ [Spec](completed/AR-16-DOMAIN-EXPANSION.md)

---

### AR-17: Haiku Fact Generation Engine
**Build the pipeline that transforms structured source data into game-ready Fact schema JSON using Claude Haiku API.** This is the engine that makes content scaling possible.

- [x] Haiku API integration script with rate limiting, retry logic, cost tracking
- [x] Domain-specific system prompts (10 knowledge domains) — each guides Haiku to generate appropriate questions, distractors, difficulty, funScore
- [x] Batch processor: reads source data JSON → calls Haiku → outputs Fact schema JSON
- [x] Output validation: schema check, distractor quality check, difficulty distribution check
- [x] Distractor generation quality checks and schema-compatible normalization bridge
- [x] Question variant generator support (3–4 variants via prompt + normalization)
- [x] Cost estimation tool: preview cost before running a batch
- [x] `visualDescription` generation integrated into the same pipeline
- [x] `wowFactor` framing generation
- [x] Dry-run mode: generate sample facts per domain for review before full batch

Depends on: AR-15 (needs source data). Estimated: Large.
Implementation status: **Tooling complete (March 10, 2026)**. Full non-dry-run execution still requires Anthropic API key and production batch run.
→ [Spec](phases/AR-17-HAIKU-FACT-ENGINE.md)

---

### AR-18: Vocabulary Expansion — 8 Languages
**Import and process vocabulary data for all 8 target languages from JMdict, CEFR frequency lists, and open lexical databases.**

- [x] JMdict full import tooling: supports JLPT N5–N1 file generation (`import-jmdict.mjs` + `build-seed-packs.mjs`)
- [x] CEFR vocabulary import scripts for: Spanish (A1–C2), French (A1–C2), German (A1–C2), Dutch (A1–C2), Czech (A1–C2)

- [x] HSK vocabulary import for Mandarin Chinese (levels 1–6)
- [x] Per-language schema extensions (reading field, romanization, example sentences)
- [ ] Language-themed visual description generation using cultural themes from GAME_DESIGN.md §22
- [x] Anki deck word list extraction: parse .apkg files for Korean/Spanish/French/German/Dutch/Czech, extract target-language words only
- [x] Haiku enrichment pipeline: generate fresh translations + CEFR/TOPIK levels from extracted word lists (creates CC0 data)
- [x] Tatoeba example sentence matching: link sentences to vocabulary entries
- [x] Difficulty mapping: JLPT/CEFR/HSK/TOPIK level → game difficulty (1–5)
- [x] Language selection UI updates (support 6 languages in onboarding + settings)
- [x] Audio placeholder system (TTS integration point for future)

Depends on: AR-15 (source registry), AR-11 Part C (visual description pipeline). Estimated: Large. No API keys required for import scripts; Haiku API needed for visual descriptions.
Implementation status: **Tooling and UI wiring in place (March 10, 2026)**. Full corpus generation/review remains pending. Visual-description generation for vocab packs remains in the separate art/content stream.
→ [Spec](phases/AR-18-VOCABULARY-EXPANSION.md)

---

### AR-19: Bulk Content Generation & Quality Assurance
**Execute the full pipeline: generate 10K+ facts per domain, verify quality, populate production database.**

- [x] Haiku generation orchestration tooling across all 10 knowledge domains (`content:generate:all`; live execution requires API key/quota)
- [x] Run vocabulary processing tooling for all 6 languages (`content:vocab:build` + `content:vocab:validate`)
- [x] Automated QA checks: schema validation, duplicate detection, distractor quality scoring (`content:qa`)
- [x] Domain coverage report: facts per domain × difficulty × age rating (`qa/coverage-report.mjs`)
- [x] Human review queue: prioritize Gold-tier sources, spot-check Silver, reject Bronze (`qa/review-sample.mjs`)
- [x] Flagging pipeline for ambiguous answers, controversial content, or stale data (`qa/flag-content-risks.mjs`)
- [ ] Generate `visualDescription` for all new facts (domain-themed for knowledge, language-themed for vocab)
- [ ] Run ComfyUI card back generation for top-priority facts (sample batch per domain)
- [x] Final coverage audit gate tooling: minimum 10K facts per knowledge domain, 5K per language (`qa/coverage-gate.mjs`)
- [x] Production database migration tooling: approved facts → `public/facts.db` (`qa/promote-approved-to-db.mjs`)

Depends on: AR-15, AR-16, AR-17, AR-18 ALL complete. Estimated: Large. **REQUIRES Anthropic API key (Haiku model)** for non-dry-run generation.
Implementation status: post-generation QA/migration tooling is in place; live generation plus visual/Comfy production runs are tracked separately.
→ [Spec](phases/AR-19-BULK-GENERATION-QA.md)

## Post-Content: Social & Monetization (Future)

### AR-20: Competitive & Social Features
- [ ] Daily Expedition (fixed seed, one attempt/day, leaderboard)
- [ ] Endless Depths (infinite scaling after Floor 9, separate leaderboard)
- [ ] Mastery Challenges (rare Mystery room, 3s timer, 5 distractors, fail = Tier 2b)
- [ ] Relic Sanctum (between-run relic management for >12 mastered)
- [ ] Wire up existing Co-op, Duel, Guild components (already built, need backend + matchmaking)

### AR-21: Monetization Activation
- [ ] Ad removal IAP ($4.99)
- [ ] Arcane Pass subscription ($4.99/mo — all packs, cosmetics, analytics, family 5x)
- [ ] Cosmetic store (card backs, frames, dungeon skins, avatars)
- [ ] Scholar Challenges (weekly curated runs + leaderboards)

### AR-27: Card Tier-Up Celebration Animations
**Visual reward feedback when cards level up during a run.** Short, satisfying animations play when a correct answer causes a card to advance tiers — blue (→Recall), green (→Deep Recall), purple/gold (→Mastered). Makes each correct answer feel like visible progress. Per-fact unique mastery animations generated as art assets in a later phase.

- [ ] Detect tier-up after correct answer (compare tier before/after FSRS update)
- [ ] Blue glow + rumble animation for Tier 1 → 2a transition
- [ ] Green glow + sparkle animation for Tier 2a → 2b transition
- [ ] Purple/gold glow animation for Tier 2b → 3 transition (integrates with Mastery Trial ceremony)
- [ ] Insert ~600ms celebration phase into answer animation sequence (between reveal and mechanic)
- [ ] Generic gold burst placeholder for per-fact mastery animation
- [ ] Per-fact unique mastery animations (art asset generation — future phase)

Depends on: None (combat system is stable). Estimated: Medium.
→ Spec: TBD

### AR-28: Reward Altar (Loot Presentation Overhaul)
**Replace post-encounter reward buttons with an atmospheric altar scene.** Spotlight falls on a biome-themed surface with rewards displayed as physical pixel-art icons (weapons, shields, potions, gold piles). Tap to inspect, select one to collect. Creates tangible "treasure on a table" feel instead of boring button lists.

- [ ] Altar scene component: spotlight cone, surface background, cloth overlay
- [ ] 4-5 biome-themed altar surface variants (cave stone, library wood, forest moss, temple marble)
- [ ] Reward icon sprite set: ~30 icons across all reward types (weapons, shields, potions, scrolls, gold, relics)
- [ ] Idle icon animations (bob, shimmer, glow pulse)
- [ ] Tap-to-inspect: icon lifts, spotlight focuses, stats tooltip appears
- [ ] Select flow: chosen reward flies to deck/inventory, others fade to shadow
- [ ] Integration with existing card-type-selection reward system (AR-09)
- [ ] SFX: ambient altar hum, icon hover, selection collect sound

Depends on: AR-09 (card type selection system — already complete). Estimated: Medium-Large.
→ Spec: TBD

### AR-29: First-Person Dungeon Crawl
**Shift combat and room exploration to first-person perspective.** Remove player character sprite from dungeon scenes — the player IS the viewpoint. Enemies and bosses rendered large and menacing, staring directly at you. Room entry fade-in transitions for atmosphere. Card hand remains at bottom, combat viewport becomes immersive first-person.

- [ ] Remove player character sprite from combat/room scenes
- [ ] Redesign combat viewport: first-person perspective with enemy filling upper screen
- [ ] Upscale enemy/boss sprites or generate larger first-person variants
- [ ] Room entry fade-in effect (fade from black or door-opening animation)
- [ ] First-person hallway view for door/room selection (2-3 doorways perspective)
- [ ] Adjust hit/damage animations for first-person framing (screen shake, flash)
- [ ] Boss encounters: even larger sprites, dramatic zoom-in on entry

### AR-30: Camp Cosmetics & Visual Progression
**Between-runs hub becomes a visual camp scene near the dungeon entrance.** Players spend gold on purely cosmetic upgrades — tent, seating, campfire, character outfit, pet companion, decorations. Each camp element is a location-aware sprite slot; upgrades swap sprite variants. Gives gold a meaningful non-gameplay sink and creates "home base" attachment.

- [ ] Camp scene layout: campfire, tent, bench, dungeon entrance backdrop, character sitting
- [ ] Menu integration: tap camp objects to navigate (tent=inventory, campfire=start run, signpost=settings)
- [ ] Upgrade tier system: 4-5 visual tiers per camp element (tent, seating, fire, decorations)
- [ ] Character cosmetic variants (outfit/armor appearance)
- [ ] Pet companion system: unlock and display pets at camp (cat, owl, fox, dragon whelp)
- [ ] Gold-to-upgrade shop UI: preview upgrade → spend gold → sprite swap
- [ ] Boss trophy display: defeated bosses leave trophies/banners at camp
- [ ] Sprite generation pipeline: location-aware camp element variants via AI image gen
- [ ] Camp state persistence (save/load upgrade levels)

Depends on: AR-08 (hub — complete). Estimated: Large.
→ Spec: TBD

GAME DESIGN OVERHAUL (March 2026):
  AR-22 (Rename) → AR-23 (Run Structure) + AR-24 (Balance/UX) + AR-25 (Notifications) → AR-26 (Docs)

FUTURE:
  AR-19 → AR-20 (Social) / AR-21 (Monetization)
  AR-27 (Tier-Up Animations) — independent, can run anytime
  AR-28 (Reward Altar) — independent, can run anytime
  AR-29 (First-Person Crawl) — independent, can run anytime
  AR-30 (Camp Cosmetics) — depends on AR-08 (complete), can run anytime
```

**Parallelism:** AR-15 and AR-16 are complete. AR-17 depends on AR-15 source outputs. AR-18 depends on AR-15 source registry. AR-19 depends on AR-17 and AR-18 completion plus QA gate passage. AR-17 and AR-19 require Anthropic API access for non-dry-run generation. AR-22→26 game design overhaul is complete (March 2026).
