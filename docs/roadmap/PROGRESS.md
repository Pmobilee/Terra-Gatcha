# Terra Gacha — Progress Tracker & Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-03-03

## How This Roadmap Works

- **This file** (`PROGRESS.md`) is the master oversight checklist
- Each phase links to a **detailed implementation document** that coding workers execute against
- Detailed docs live in `docs/roadmap/phases/` (not started), `docs/roadmap/in-progress/` (active), or `docs/roadmap/completed/` (done)
- Each phase doc contains: granular sub-steps, file paths, acceptance criteria, Playwright tests, and verification gates
- See `CLAUDE.md` → "Roadmap Workflow" for the full execution protocol

## Vision

Terra Gacha is a mobile-first 2D pixel-art mining roguelite where each dive fuels a long-term knowledge journey. The player crash-lands on a far-future Earth, excavates procedural mines for minerals and artifacts, and returns to the dome to ingest discoveries through GAIA, review facts with spaced repetition, and grow a living Knowledge Tree. The core fantasy is rediscovering Earth one artifact at a time.

## Current State

Phases 0-8.13 complete. Phases 11, 13, 18 complete. Visual Overhaul (A-I) complete. Phase 18 delivered: DevPanel scenario presets (9 one-click states), save snapshots with import/export, session design metrics (dual profiles, cozy dome flow), gentle review pressure audit (zero anxiety-inducing language), quiz anti-homework pass (all quiz text uses adventure vocabulary), CI/CD pipelines (3 GitHub Actions workflows), Vitest testing setup, seed determinism tests, and build-time asset audit. V2 roadmap (remaining phases 9-25) in progress.
