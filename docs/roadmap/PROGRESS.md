# Terra-Gacha Progress Tracker & Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-02-28 (Phase 1 Complete)

## How This Roadmap Works

- **This file** (`PROGRESS.md`) is the master index of all phases
- **`completed/`** contains detailed records of finished phases with all sub-tasks checked off
- **`in-progress/`** contains detailed, codex-executable task documents for active phases
- Each in-progress document has step-by-step instructions a coding agent can follow without creative interpretation
- When a sub-phase is complete, its document moves from `in-progress/` to `completed/`
- The Opus model (planner) creates these documents; Codex models (builders) execute them

## Vision

Terra-Gacha is a mobile-first 2D pixel-art mining roguelite where each dive fuels a long-term knowledge journey. The player crash-lands on a far-future Earth, excavates procedural mines for minerals and artifacts, and returns to the dome to ingest discoveries through GIAI (the ship AI), review facts with spaced repetition, and grow a living Knowledge Tree. The core fantasy is rediscovering Earth one artifact at a time while building an emotionally sticky loop of risk, reward, and curiosity.

The full vision extends far beyond the MVP: layered biome progression, in-run relic builds, meaningful economy and crafting, fossilized pet revival, base expansion, social systems, seasonal live ops, and eventually language-learning depth. Every system serves four pillars from `docs/GAME_DESIGN.md`: addictive learning, roguelite replayability, gacha dopamine, and visible permanent progression.

## Current State: Phase 1 Complete + Post-Phase 1 Improvements ✅

The MVP is fully polished with complete content pipeline, audio integration, balance tuning, and mobile optimization. The game now features 500+ seed vocabulary entries with spaced repetition, particle effects and animations, varied audio feedback, refined gameplay balance, and optimized mobile controls.

### Post-Phase 1 Improvements (added 2026-02-28)
These features were added after Phase 1 completion as gameplay enhancements:

- [x] **Upgrade Crate system**: 4 upgrade types (pickaxe boost, scanner boost, backpack expand, O2 efficiency) drop from UpgradeCrate blocks in the mine
- [x] **Stackable upgrades**: Upgrades can be collected multiple times and stack their effects (linear scaling for pickaxe/scanner/backpack, exponential for O2 efficiency)
- [x] **Run Stats panel**: New overlay panel (like backpack) shows all active upgrades with stack counts, computed effect values, and current run stats (depth, blocks mined, oxygen)
- [x] **Depth-based block distribution**: Block composition changes with depth (more stone/hardrock deeper)
- [x] **Depth-based mineral tiers**: Shards appear after 40% depth, crystals after 70% depth
- [x] **Exit room with multi-question gate**: Exit room at mine bottom with a golden quiz gate requiring 3 correct answers to pass
- [x] **Dive streak tracking**: Daily streak system with +1 bonus oxygen tank at 3+ day streak
- [x] **Dive results screen**: Post-dive summary showing dust, shards, crystals, artifacts, blocks mined, and streak info
- [x] **Upgrade crate visual improvements**: Bright gold color, pulsing glow border, white up-arrow symbol
- [x] **HUD upgrade indicators**: Letter badges (P/S/B/O) with stack count badges, tap to open Run Stats panel
- [x] **Upgrade toast notifications**: Center-screen toast when collecting upgrades

The foundation is solid and ready for knowledge system expansion in Phase 2.

### Visual & System Improvements (added 2026-02-28)
- [x] **Fog of war with sprite textures**: Ring-1 and ring-2 fog blocks now render actual tile/block sprites with dimming overlays instead of flat color fills
- [x] **Sprite resolution toggle**: Settings card on BaseView with Low (32px) / High (256px) toggle, persisted in localStorage, reload to switch
- [x] **Manifest-driven sprite loading**: `spriteManifest.ts` uses `import.meta.glob` to dynamically load sprites by resolution; BootScene loads from manifest instead of static imports
- [x] **MineralNode/ArtifactNode rendering fix**: All block types now render their sprites in fog (ring-1/ring-2) — previously MineralNode and ArtifactNode showed as pure black
- [x] **Migrate facts storage from static JSON imports to in-browser SQLite via sql.js**: `scripts/build-facts-db.mjs` builds `public/facts.db` at build time; `src/services/factsDB.ts` provides async singleton interface; `main.ts` initializes before boot

---

## PHASE 0: MVP Core Loop ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Test core hypothesis - "mining + artifacts + learning is fun"

### Completed Systems

- [x] Step 6: Add seed content in `src/data/seed/vocab-n3.json` (~50 entries)
- [x] Step 7: Build `MineGenerator` with seeded procedural generation
- [x] Step 8: Build `OxygenSystem` for dive oxygen state/cost handling
- [x] Step 9: Build `MiningSystem` for hardness/mining/content resolution
- [x] Step 10: Add `Player` entity for grid position/movement state
- [x] Step 11: Create `MineScene` with mining input/render/event emissions
- [x] Step 12: Update `GameManager` to register/start/end mine scenes
- [x] Step 13: Create Svelte stores in `gameState.ts` and `playerData.ts`
- [x] Step 14: Create `HUD.svelte`
- [x] Step 15: Create `QuizOverlay.svelte`
- [x] Step 16: Create `BackpackOverlay.svelte`
- [x] Step 17: Create `FactReveal.svelte`
- [x] Step 18: Create `DivePrepScreen.svelte`
- [x] Step 19: Create `BaseView.svelte`
- [x] Step 20: Update `App.svelte` screen router

- [x] Step 22: Integrate full dive loop (prep -> mine -> surface -> resolve)
- [x] Step 23: Integrate base study loop for due-review quizzes
- [x] Step 24: Update `BootScene` to load/initialize seed content
- [x] Step 25: Complete typecheck/build/playability validation pass
