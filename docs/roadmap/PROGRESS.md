# Arcane Recall — Implementation Roadmap

> Design source of truth: `docs/GAME_DESIGN.md`
> Card roguelite spec: `docs/RESEARCH/02_terra-miner-card-roguelite-spec.md`

---

## Current Status

**Playable pre-launch build.** AR-01 through AR-06 complete. Core combat, FSRS, visual assets, onboarding, sound/engagement, and knowledge library all implemented.

**Critical context:** Many features are BUILT but NOT ACCESSIBLE from the app UI. The app currently opens straight to "start run" with no hub navigation. Knowledge Library, Settings, Parental Controls, Streak display, Leaderboards, and Profile all exist as Svelte components but have no entry point. AR-08 fixes this.

**Calibration decision RESOLVED.** Option B (accelerated FSRS gains during early runs) selected. See GAME_DESIGN.md §14. No longer blocked.

**Deck building redesigned.** Card rewards now use type-selection (player picks card TYPE, random fact assigned). Archetype selection at run start. See GAME_DESIGN.md §7. AR-09 implements this.

**Next up:** AR-08 (Hub Navigation) → AR-09 (Strategic Deck Building) → AR-10 (Calibration) can run in parallel with AR-11 (Content Pipeline). Then AR-12 (Auth) → AR-13 (Launch Readiness) → AR-14 (Soft Launch).

## In Progress

### AR-04: Onboarding + Difficulty Modes (3/4 done)

- [x] **60-second onboarding** — Dungeon entrance, Slow Reader question, first encounter with 2 AP, contextual tooltips. Domain selection unlocks on Run 2.
- [x] **Difficulty modes** — Explorer (no timer, wrong=50% effect, enemies -30%), Standard (current), Scholar (-2s/tier, wrong=fizzle+3 self-damage, enemies +20%).
- [ ] **Calibration system** — Design RESOLVED (Option B: accelerated FSRS). Implementation deferred to AR-10.
- [x] **Hint system** — 1 Scholar's Insight per encounter: remove 1 wrong answer, +5s timer, or reveal first letter.

→ [Spec](phases/AR-04-ONBOARDING.md)

### AR-07: Launch Readiness (2/6 done — being superseded by AR-13)

- [ ] ~~Capacitor build verification~~ → moved to AR-13
- [x] **Accessibility baseline** — Colorblind support, 3 text sizes, high contrast, reduce motion, 48dp+ touch targets.
- [ ] ~~Playwright E2E test suite~~ → expanded in AR-13
- [ ] ~~Performance audit~~ → moved to AR-13
- [ ] ~~Dead code cleanup~~ → moved to AR-13
- [x] **App store metadata** — Screenshots, description, privacy policy, age rating.

Note: AR-07 is being superseded by AR-13 which has a broader scope including web deployment, PWA, and the new deck building/hub features that must be tested. The completed items (accessibility, metadata) stand.

→ [Spec](phases/AR-07-LAUNCH-READINESS.md)

## Next Phases (Pre-Launch)

### AR-08: Hub Navigation & Feature Discovery
**Surface all built-but-hidden features.** Create main hub/home screen with navigation to Start Run, Knowledge Library, Settings, Profile. Add streak display, last run summary widget, post-run share image generator. Wire up existing components that currently have no entry point.

- [ ] Main hub screen with tab/nav bar
- [ ] Knowledge Library accessible from hub
- [ ] Settings + Parental Controls accessible
- [ ] Profile screen accessible
- [ ] Streak display on home screen
- [ ] Last run summary widget
- [ ] Post-run share image generator (Wordle-style)
- [ ] Run start flow preserved (domain selection → archetype → run)

Depends on: None. Estimated: Medium.
→ [Spec](phases/AR-08-HUB-NAVIGATION.md)

---

### AR-09: Strategic Deck Building (Card Type Selection)
**Replace random card rewards with type-selection for strategic deck building.** Players choose card TYPE after encounters (Attack/Shield/Heal/etc.), random fact assigned. Starter deck reduced to 15. Archetype selection at run start weights type options.

- [ ] Card reward screen redesign: 3 TYPE options instead of 3 random cards
- [ ] Type-to-fact random assignment on selection
- [ ] Starter deck reduced from 20 to 15 cards
- [ ] Archetype selection UI at run start (Balanced/Aggressive/Defensive/Control/Hybrid)
- [ ] Archetype weighting logic for reward type options
- [ ] Card selling/removal at shop rooms
- [ ] Balance pass: starter deck composition, type distribution

Depends on: None. Estimated: Medium.
→ [Spec](phases/AR-09-STRATEGIC-DECK-BUILDING.md)

---

### AR-10: Calibration & Cold Start Resolution
**Implement accelerated FSRS gains during early runs (Option B).** Finishes the last item from AR-04.

- [ ] Early run boost: correct + fast (under 50% timer) = 2x stability gain during runs 1-3
- [ ] Run accuracy bonus: 80%+ = flat +2d stability to all correct facts
- [ ] First-time correct starts at 2d stability instead of 1d
- [ ] Domain-specific acceleration on first selection of new domain
- [ ] RunPoolBuilder probe mode: diverse-difficulty front-loading in first run per domain
- [ ] Runs-per-domain tracking in player profile

Depends on: AR-02 (done). Estimated: Small-Medium.
→ [Spec](phases/AR-10-CALIBRATION-COLD-START.md)

---

### AR-11: Content Pipeline Infrastructure (Claude CLI + Ingestion + Visual Descriptions)
**Build the full content production pipeline: Claude CLI fact generation → validation → ingestion → language-themed visual description generation → card back art.** This is the engine that scales from 122 facts to 10K+ per domain.

**Part A: Claude CLI Fact Generation Setup**
- [ ] System prompts for fact generation per domain (Science, History, Geography, etc.)
- [ ] System prompts for vocabulary generation per language (Japanese, Spanish, French, etc.)
- [ ] Source citation requirement: every fact MUST have a `sourceName` (Wikipedia preferred)
- [ ] Fact-checking validation: cross-reference generated facts against source
- [ ] Output format: JSON matching seed data schema (all columns populated)
- [ ] Distractor generation: 5+ plausible distractors per fact, close enough to challenge
- [ ] Question variant generation: 3-4 variants per fact (forward, reverse, fill-blank, true/false)

**Part B: Ingestion & Validation**
- [ ] CLI tool for bulk fact ingestion from JSON
- [ ] Schema validation (all required fields, variant count ≥ 2, distractor count ≥ 2)
- [ ] Duplicate detection (fuzzy match on question text)
- [ ] Domain coverage report (facts per domain, per difficulty, age rating distribution)
- [ ] Distractor quality flagging (too easy / too similar to correct answer)
- [ ] Migration to sql.js database (public/facts.db + seed-pack.json)
- [ ] `verifiedAt` workflow: unverified → verified via CLI command

**Part C: Language-Themed Visual Description Generation**
- [ ] Delete ALL existing vocab card visual descriptions (current ones are generic/bad)
- [ ] New visual description system prompts PER LANGUAGE with cultural theming rules
- [ ] Japanese: feudal Japan, torii gates, zen gardens, ukiyo-e palette, cherry blossoms
- [ ] Spanish: Mediterranean/Latin American, terracotta, flamenco, warm sunset tones
- [ ] French: Belle Époque, cobblestone cafés, lavender fields, romantic lighting
- [ ] (Additional languages follow same pattern — see GAME_DESIGN.md §22)
- [ ] Anti-pattern detection: reject generic fantasy scenes with no cultural identity
- [ ] Integration with existing `generate-visual-descriptions.mjs` pipeline
- [ ] Regenerate all 400 Japanese N3 vocab visual descriptions with Japan-themed prompts

**Part D: Documentation**
- [ ] Document full pipeline so it can be run independently via Claude CLI
- [ ] Example commands for each step (generate → validate → ingest → visual descriptions)
- [ ] Quality checklist for reviewing generated content before approval

Depends on: None. Estimated: Large. **Can run in parallel with AR-08/09/10. CRITICAL PATH for content scaling.**
→ [Spec](phases/AR-11-CONTENT-PIPELINE.md)

---

### AR-12: Anonymous Auth & Cloud Save
**Enable progress persistence across devices.** Anonymous device ID on first launch, optional account creation to claim profile, cloud save via Fastify backend.

- [ ] Anonymous device-based identity (UUID, stored locally)
- [ ] Optional email/password account creation
- [ ] Cloud save endpoints: push/pull player state (FSRS, run history, unlocks)
- [ ] Conflict resolution: prefer higher-progress state
- [ ] Guest-to-account migration
- [ ] Login UI in Settings (minimal, non-blocking)
- [ ] Auto-sync on run completion, graceful offline fallback

Depends on: AR-08 (Settings accessible). Estimated: Medium-Large.
→ [Spec](phases/AR-12-AUTH-CLOUD-SAVE.md)

---

### AR-13: Launch Readiness (supersedes AR-07)
**Everything needed for Malaysia soft launch (web-first, Capacitor native later).**

- [ ] Performance audit: 60fps combat, <3s cold start, <150MB memory
- [ ] Full Playwright E2E test suite (hub, run flow, type selection, FSRS, combos, relics, save/load)
- [ ] Dead code cleanup (archive mining-era code, remove unused social nav entries)
- [ ] PWA configuration (manifest, service worker, offline, app icons)
- [ ] Web deployment (Vercel/Netlify)
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry or equivalent)
- [ ] Share image generator verification
- [ ] Responsive layout on common mobile screen sizes
- [ ] Capacitor native builds (Android + iOS) — stretch goal

Depends on: AR-08, AR-09. Estimated: Medium.
→ [Spec](phases/AR-13-LAUNCH-READINESS.md)

---

### AR-14: Soft Launch & Analytics
**Ship to limited market, measure everything, iterate.**

- [ ] Deploy web build to public URL
- [ ] Instrument 10+ critical funnels (onboarding, runs, answers, domains, cash-out, deaths, tiers, bounties, streaks, shares)
- [ ] A/B test experiments: Slow Reader default, 3 vs 4 AP, starter deck 15 vs 18
- [ ] Malaysia geo-targeting or invite codes
- [ ] In-app feedback button in Settings
- [ ] Weekly analytics dashboard
- [ ] Fix top 5 issues from first-week data

Depends on: AR-12 (cloud save), AR-13 (deployed build). Estimated: Medium.
→ [Spec](phases/AR-14-SOFT-LAUNCH-ANALYTICS.md)

---

## Post-Soft-Launch Phases (Future)

### AR-15: Content Expansion & Language Packs
- [ ] Scale to 10K+ facts per domain via content pipeline
- [ ] Language pack framework (audio, furigana, production cards at Tier 2+)
- [ ] First language pack: Japanese N5 (800 vocabulary facts)
- [ ] Domain pack IAP ($2.99) and language pack IAP ($4.99)
- [ ] Age gating filter at query level

### AR-16: Competitive & Social Features
- [ ] Daily Expedition (fixed seed, one attempt/day, leaderboard)
- [ ] Endless Depths (infinite scaling after Floor 9, separate leaderboard)
- [ ] Mastery Challenges (rare Mystery room, 3s timer, 5 distractors, fail = Tier 2b)
- [ ] Relic Sanctum (between-run relic management for >12 mastered)
- [ ] Wire up existing Co-op, Duel, Guild components (already built, need backend + matchmaking)

### AR-17: Monetization Activation
- [ ] Ad removal IAP ($4.99)
- [ ] Arcane Pass subscription ($4.99/mo — all packs, cosmetics, analytics, family 5x)
- [ ] Cosmetic store (card backs, frames, dungeon skins, avatars)
- [ ] Scholar Challenges (weekly curated runs + leaderboards)

## Dependency Graph

```
COMPLETED:
  AR-01 ──┬── AR-02 ──┬── AR-04 (3/4) ── AR-05 ✓ ── AR-06 ✓
          └── AR-03 ──┘

NEXT (parallel tracks):
  Track A: AR-08 (Hub) → AR-09 (Deck Building) ──→ AR-13 (Launch) → AR-14 (Soft Launch)
  Track B: AR-11 (Content Pipeline) ─────────────┘        ↑
  Track C: AR-10 (Calibration) ──────────────────────────┘
  Track D: AR-12 (Auth) ─────────────────────────────────→ AR-14

FUTURE:
  AR-14 → AR-15 (Content) / AR-16 (Social) / AR-17 (Monetization)
```

**Parallelism:** AR-08, AR-09, AR-10, and AR-11 have NO dependencies on each other and can all be worked in parallel. AR-12 needs AR-08 (for Settings access). AR-13 needs AR-08 + AR-09. AR-14 needs everything.
