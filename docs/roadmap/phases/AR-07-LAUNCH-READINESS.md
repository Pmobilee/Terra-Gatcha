## Implementation

### Sub-task 1: Capacitor Build Verification

#### Android

1. Run `npx cap sync android` — sync web build to Android project
2. Open in Android Studio: `npx cap open android`
3. Verify:
   - App launches on Pixel 7 emulator (API 34) without crash
   - Status bar: dark background, light icons, does not overlap content
   - Navigation bar: transparent, 16dp safe area at bottom respected
   - Keyboard: does not push layout up unexpectedly (relevant for Scholar free-recall input)
   - Orientation: locked to portrait (`android:screenOrientation="portrait"` in AndroidManifest.xml)
   - Permissions: none required (no camera, microphone, location)
   - Splash screen: dark background, app icon centered, <2s display
   - App icon: 192×192 adaptive icon (foreground + background layers)
   - Haptics: `@capacitor/haptics` works on physical device

4. Fix common issues:
   - `capacitor.config.ts`: set `server.androidScheme: 'https'` for secure context
   - `AndroidManifest.xml`: `android:usesCleartextTraffic="false"`
   - Safe area CSS: `env(safe-area-inset-top)`, `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`

#### iOS

1. Run `npx cap sync ios` — sync web build to iOS project
2. Open in Xcode: `npx cap open ios`
3. Verify:
   - App launches on iPhone 15 Pro simulator (iOS 17) without crash
   - Status bar: content inset below notch/Dynamic Island
   - Home indicator: 16dp bottom safe area (gesture nav)
   - Orientation: locked to portrait (Info.plist `UISupportedInterfaceOrientations`)
   - No permissions requested
   - Splash screen: LaunchScreen.storyboard with dark background + centered icon
   - App icon: 1024×1024 for App Store, scaled versions auto-generated
   - Haptics: Core Haptics via Capacitor works

4. Fix common issues:
   - WKWebView configuration in `capacitor.config.ts`
   - `viewport-fit=cover` in `index.html` `<meta>` tag for safe areas
   - CSS: `-webkit-touch-callout: none` to prevent long-press context menus on cards

### Sub-task 2: Accessibility Baseline

#### Visual Accessibility

**Colorblind support:**
- Every UI element that uses color as a differentiator MUST also have a shape or icon:
  - Card types: each type has a unique icon (sword=attack, shield=shield, heart=heal, arrow-up=buff, skull=debuff, gear=utility, leaf=regen, star=wild) IN ADDITION to color
  - Tier badges: T1=circle, T2a=triangle, T2b=diamond, T3=star — in addition to color
  - HP bars: show numeric value alongside bar
  - Timer bar: show seconds as text alongside bar
  - Combo counter: show numeric multiplier (already exists)
  - Domain: icon (from AR-03) + name, not just color tint

**3 text sizes:**
```typescript
type TextSize = 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';

const TEXT_SCALE: Record<TextSize, number> = {
  small: 0.85,   // -15%
  medium: 1.0,   // Default
  large: 1.2,    // +20%
};
```

Apply via CSS custom property: `--text-scale: 1.0;` on `:root`, multiply all `font-size` values.

Implementation: In settings, add "Text Size" selector with 3 options. Save to `playerProfile.textSize`. Apply on app start via `document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--text-scale', scale)`.

Text that MUST scale: card names, mechanic descriptions, question text, answer text, stat labels, menu items, tooltips. Text that does NOT scale: tiny UI labels (AP counter, floor number).

**High contrast mode:**
- Toggle in settings: `playerProfile.highContrast: boolean`
- When enabled: increase all text contrast to WCAG AA (4.5:1 ratio minimum)
- Background darkens, text brightens, borders thicken by 1px
- Apply via CSS class `.high-contrast` on body

**Reduce motion:**
- Toggle in settings: `playerProfile.reduceMotion: boolean`
- When enabled: disable screen shake, particle effects, card launch animations
- Keep: haptics (independent), damage numbers (static, no arc), HP bar changes (instant, no tween)
- Phaser: skip all tweens, hide particle emitters
- Svelte: add `prefers-reduced-motion` media query support + manual toggle

#### Motor Accessibility

- Verify ALL interactive elements ≥ 48×48dp touch target
- Audit every button, card, answer option, menu item
- No swipe gestures required — tap only
- No drag-and-drop — tap to select, tap to confirm
- Explorer mode: no timer (already from AR-04)
- Slow Reader: +3s (already from AR-01/AR-04)

#### Cognitive Accessibility

- Explorer mode with 50% wrong penalty (already from AR-04)
- Hint system (already from AR-04)
- All numeric values shown with icons (AP gems + number, HP bar + number)
- Question text at 6th-grade reading level (verify existing facts DB)
- No sudden unexpected events (all enemy actions telegraphed)

### Sub-task 3: Playwright E2E Test Suite

Create comprehensive E2E tests covering all game systems. Tests in `tests/e2e/playwright/`:

```typescript
// Test categories and what they verify:

// 1. app-loads.spec.ts — App boots, no console errors, correct initial screen
// 2. onboarding-flow.spec.ts — Dungeon entrance → slow reader → first combat → tooltips
// 3. card-play-flow.spec.ts — 3-stage commit: tap card (front only) → Cast → answer
// 4. combat-mechanics.spec.ts — AP deduction, skip free, end turn, enemy turn, victory/defeat
// 5. dynamic-timer.spec.ts — Floor-based timer, word bonus, slow reader bonus
// 6. domain-decoupling.spec.ts — Same domain has different card types in pool
// 7. combo-system.spec.ts — Combo builds on consecutive correct, resets on wrong
// 8. echo-mechanic.spec.ts — Wrong answer → echo card reappears later
// 9. passive-relics.spec.ts — Tier 3 → passive relic, dormancy on low retrievability
// 10. room-selection.spec.ts — 3 doors, room types, rest/treasure/mystery/shop
// 11. retreat-or-delve.spec.ts — Checkpoint after boss, retreat keeps 100%, continue risks
// 12. card-reward.spec.ts — Victory → pick 1 of 3 cards → added to deck
// 13. fsrs-scheduling.spec.ts — Tier derivation from stability, variant rotation
// 14. difficulty-modes.spec.ts — Explorer (no timer), Standard, Scholar (self-damage)
// 15. hint-system.spec.ts — 1 hint/encounter, 3 types, resets each encounter
// 16. knowledge-library.spec.ts — Domain list, fact list, fact detail, filter/sort
// 17. lore-discovery.spec.ts — Unlock at 10/25/50/100 mastered, presentation, gallery
// 18. bounty-quests.spec.ts — Selection, progress tracking, completion
// 19. streak-system.spec.ts — Daily count, freeze, milestones
// 20. run-summary.spec.ts — Post-run stats, share image generation
// 21. save-resume.spec.ts — Save after encounter, resume on reload
// 22. accessibility.spec.ts — Touch targets ≥48dp, text scaling, high contrast, reduce motion
// 23. performance.spec.ts — 60fps during combat (Phaser), cold start <3s
```

Each test uses dev bypass: `?skipOnboarding=true&devpreset=post_tutorial`

Dev presets needed (add to `CardGameManager.ts` or equivalent):
- `post_tutorial`: skip onboarding, auto-select domains, start at encounter 1
- `mid_run`: floor 5, 60 HP, 3 relics, deck with mixed tiers
- `boss_fight`: floor 3 boss encounter
- `low_hp`: 15 HP, floor 4, testing defeat/retreat
- `mastery_ready`: facts with stability 30+, 7 consecutive correct, ready for mastery trial
- `library_populated`: 50+ facts with mixed tiers for knowledge library testing

### Sub-task 4: Performance Audit

#### Targets

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Combat FPS | ≥55fps sustained (60fps target) | Phaser `game.loop.actualFps` logged every 5s |
| Cold start | <3s to interactive | Playwright `performance.timing.domInteractive` |
| Run state size | <50KB JSON | `JSON.stringify(runState).length` |
| FSRS data (500 facts) | <25KB | `JSON.stringify(factStates).length` |
| Memory (combat) | <150MB | `performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize` (Chrome) |
| Particle cap | ≤50 active | Phaser particle manager count |
| Game objects (combat) | ≤20 | `scene.children.length` |

#### Optimization Checklist

1. **Phaser sprite pool:** Verify 5 pre-created card sprites (reposition, don't create/destroy)
2. **Particle cap:** Verify 50 particle max, 300ms lifespan for correct answer burst (30 particles)
3. **Tween cleanup:** Verify all Phaser tweens complete and are removed (no tween leaks)
4. **Image optimization:** All PNGs compressed with `pngquant`. Sprite sheets instead of individual images.
5. **Font subsetting:** `PressStart2P` font subset to used characters only (ASCII + basic symbols)
6. **Bundle size:** Vite tree-shaking removes all dead mining code. Target <500KB gzipped JS.
7. **Lazy loading:** Knowledge Library and Lore gallery loaded on demand (dynamic import)

#### Performance Test Script

Create `tests/e2e/performance-audit.cjs`:
```javascript
// Navigate to combat, play 10 cards, measure:
// - FPS during card animations
// - Memory at start and end
// - Run state JSON size
// - Cold start time
// Report pass/fail against targets
```

### Sub-task 5: Dead Code Cleanup

#### Remove

| Path | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `src/_archived-mining/` | Entire directory — mining-era code, not imported anywhere |
| `src/game/scenes/MineScene.ts` | Mining-specific Phaser scene (if exists) |
| `src/game/managers/` | Mining-era managers (BiomeManager, HazardManager, etc.) — if not used by card roguelite |
| Old `App.svelte` | If exists alongside `CardApp.svelte` and is unreferenced |
| Old `GameManager.ts` | If exists alongside `CardGameManager.ts` and is unreferenced |
| `src/services/sm2.ts` | Deprecated by AR-02 (FSRS migration). Remove after FSRS is stable. |
| Unused balance constants | Any `SM2_*` constants in balance.ts after FSRS migration |
| Stale test files | Tests for removed mining code |

#### Verification

Before deleting:
1. `grep -r "import.*from.*<file>" src/` — confirm zero imports
2. `npm run build` — confirm build succeeds after removal
3. `npx vitest run` — confirm all tests pass
4. `npm run typecheck` — confirm no type errors

### Sub-task 6: App Store Metadata

#### Prepare (not submit — manual submission by human)

Create `docs/APP_STORE.md` with:

```markdown
## App Name
Arcane Recall

## Subtitle (30 chars)
Learn Facts. Build Decks. Delve.

## Description (4000 chars max)
[Draft compelling description highlighting: educational card roguelite, spaced repetition, 500+ facts, multiple domains, no ads in core game, privacy-first]

## Keywords
education, card game, roguelite, trivia, flashcards, learning, quiz, spaced repetition, study, knowledge

## Category
Primary: Education
Secondary: Games → Card

## Age Rating
4+ (no violence, no mature content, no user-generated content, no unrestricted web access)

## Privacy Policy URL
[Placeholder — needs legal review]

## Screenshots Needed
1. Combat screen with cards in hand (portrait)
2. Card committed with question visible
3. Domain selection screen
4. Knowledge Library
5. Run summary / Adventurer's Journal
6. Room selection with doors

Generate via Playwright at correct device resolutions:
- iPhone 6.7" (1290×2796) — iPhone 15 Pro Max
- iPhone 6.1" (1179×2556) — iPhone 15 Pro
- iPad 12.9" (2048×2732) — iPad Pro
- Android phone (1080×2400) — Pixel 7
- Android tablet (1600×2560) — Samsung Tab S7
```

### System Interactions

- **All AR phases:** AR-07 is the final integration gate. Every feature from AR-01 through AR-06 must be verified.
- **Capacitor:** @capacitor/haptics, @capacitor/preferences, @capacitor/share — all must work on native builds.
- **Phaser:** Performance audit directly tests CombatScene rendering.
- **FSRS:** Save state migration must survive Capacitor preferences roundtrip.
- **Accessibility:** Affects all UI components from all phases.
- **Dead code removal:** Must not break any imports or tests.

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Android API 28 (oldest supported) | App launches, all features work. May have minor visual differences. |
| iOS 15 (oldest supported) | App launches, safe areas handled correctly. |
| Device with no haptic motor | Haptics calls silently no-op. No crash. |
| Very small screen (320dp width) | Cards scale down. Touch targets remain ≥48dp. Text may truncate with ellipsis. |
| Very large screen (tablet) | Content centered with max-width. No stretching beyond 480dp content width. |
| Airplane mode | App works fully offline. No network-dependent features in v1. |
| Low memory device (<2GB RAM) | Particle effects reduced. Sprite quality downgraded if needed. |
| Text size "large" + long question | Text wraps. Answer buttons grow in height. Scrollable if needed. |
| High contrast + dark mode OS | High contrast takes priority. Consistent appearance. |
| Reduce motion + combo milestone | No particles, no screen shake. Combo text still shows. Haptic still fires. |
| App backgrounded during combat | State auto-saved. Resume picks up where left off. Timer paused. |
| Delete and reinstall app | All progress lost (local storage only v1). Expected. |
| Run state exactly 50KB | Valid. At limit but not over. |
| Run state >50KB | Log warning. Still save. Investigate what's bloating state. |
