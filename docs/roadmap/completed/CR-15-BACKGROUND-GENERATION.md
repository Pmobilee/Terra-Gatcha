# CR-15: Background Generation

> Phase: P2 — Art Pipeline + First Asset Pass
> Priority: HIGH
> Depends on: CR-14 (NB1 Art Pipeline Setup)
> Estimated scope: M

Generate 6 priority backgrounds for all major game screens using the NB1 pipeline established in CR-14. Backgrounds do NOT use green screen — they are generated directly as full-frame images, then cropped to 9:20 portrait aspect ratio and downscaled to 270x600 virtual pixels. All backgrounds must read as cohesive fantasy dungeon/cavern environments with consistent pixel art style.

## Design Reference

From `sprite-gen/GENERAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md`:

> **Virtual resolution:** 270x600px (portrait, 9:20 aspect ratio)
> **Scale factor:** 4x nearest-neighbor to 1080x2400 device pixels

> | Type | Virtual Size | Device Size | Quantity Needed |
> | Combat background | 270x600 | 1080x2400 | 4-5 themed variants (1 for prototype) |
> | Title screen | 270x600 | 1080x2400 | 1 |
> | Room/path selection screen | 270x600 | 1080x2400 | 1 |
> | Shop screen | 270x600 | 1080x2400 | 1 |
> | Rest area screen | 270x600 | 1080x2400 | 1 |

> **Design note:** Top ~55% of combat backgrounds is visible during gameplay. Bottom 45% is covered by card hand and UI. Place focal point in upper-center where enemies stand.

From `docs/GAME_DESIGN.md` (Split-Stage Portrait Layout):
> Top 55% = display zone (Phaser canvas — combat, enemies, effects)
> Bottom 45% = interaction zone (Svelte DOM — card hand, quiz, buttons)

## Implementation

### Data Model

#### Prompt Manifest Entries

Add 6 background entries to `sprite-gen/arcane-prompts.json` (created in CR-14) under the `"backgrounds"` array:

```json

      "useGreenScreen": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Logic

#### Background Post-Processing

Backgrounds follow a different pipeline from sprites (no green screen, aspect ratio crop instead of auto-crop).

**Processing steps for each background:**

1. **Generate** via NB1 API (same as sprites — `processSprite` from CR-14's `post-process.mjs` with `useGreenScreen: false`)
2. **Aspect ratio crop to 9:20 portrait** — NB1 may return a square or landscape image. Crop from center to the correct aspect ratio:

```javascript
/**
 * Crop an image to 9:20 portrait aspect ratio from center.
 * If image is already portrait (taller than wide), crop height from center.
 * If image is landscape (wider than tall), crop width from center.
 *
 * @param {Buffer} pngBuffer
 * @returns {Promise<Buffer>}
 */
async function cropToPortrait(pngBuffer) {
  const metadata = await sharp(pngBuffer).metadata();
  const { width, height } = metadata;

  // Target aspect ratio: 9:20
  const targetRatio = 9 / 20; // 0.45

  let cropW, cropH, left, top;

  if (width / height > targetRatio) {
    // Image is too wide — crop width
    cropH = height;
    cropW = Math.round(height * targetRatio);
    left = Math.round((width - cropW) / 2);
    top = 0;
  } else {
    // Image is too tall — crop height
    cropW = width;
    cropH = Math.round(width / targetRatio);
    top = Math.round((height - cropH) / 2);
    left = 0;
  }

  return sharp(pngBuffer)
    .extract({ left, top, width: cropW, height: cropH })
    .png()
    .toBuffer();
}
```

Add this function to `sprite-gen/lib/post-process.mjs` (created in CR-14).

3. **Nearest-neighbor downscale** to 270x600 virtual pixels
4. **Optional saturation reduction** for combat background only — reduce saturation by ~15% so foreground sprites pop against the background:

```javascript
// For combat background only:
buf = await sharp(buf)
  .modulate({ saturation: 0.85 })
  .png()
  .toBuffer();
```

5. **Save as PNG** (no alpha channel needed — backgrounds are opaque):

```javascript
buf = await sharp(buf)
  .flatten({ background: { r: 0, g: 0, b: 0 } }) // Remove alpha, fill with black
  .png()
  .toBuffer();
```

#### Generation Order

Generate backgrounds in this order (most important first, so if budget runs low, critical screens are covered):

1. `bg_combat_dungeon` — needed for combat scene
2. `bg_menu_title` — needed for main menu
3. `bg_room_selection` — needed for room selection
4. `bg_rest_area` — needed for rest room overlay
5. `bg_shop` — needed for future shop overlay
6. `bg_treasure` — needed for future treasure overlay

Run with: `npm run generate:arcane-sprites -- --category backgrounds`

Or individually: `npm run generate:arcane-sprites -- --id bg_combat_dungeon`

#### Sprite Registry Updates

After each background is generated, add to `sprite-registry.json` under the `arcaneRecall` array:

```json
{
  "key": "bg_combat_dungeon",
  "category": "backgrounds",
  "subcategory": "combat",
  "prompt": "A dark stone dungeon corridor...",
  "model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash-image",
  "targetSizes": { "full": [270, 600] },
  "outputPaths": {
    "original": "sprite-gen/output/backgrounds/bg_combat_dungeon_original.png",
    "final": "public/assets/backgrounds/combat/dungeon.png"
  },
  "generatedAt": "2026-03-09T12:00:00Z"
}
```

#### Output File Mapping

| Manifest ID | Output Path |
|-------------|-------------|
| `bg_combat_dungeon` | `public/assets/backgrounds/combat/dungeon.png` |
| `bg_menu_title` | `public/assets/backgrounds/menu/title.png` |
| `bg_room_selection` | `public/assets/backgrounds/rooms/selection.png` |
| `bg_rest_area` | `public/assets/backgrounds/rooms/rest.png` |
| `bg_shop` | `public/assets/backgrounds/rooms/shop.png` |
| `bg_treasure` | `public/assets/backgrounds/rooms/treasure.png` |

The filename for backgrounds is derived from the manifest ID by stripping the `bg_` prefix and the subcategory prefix. The generation script must map `id` to the correct output path based on `subcategory`. Add a `filename` override field to the manifest if the automatic mapping is ambiguous:

```json
{
  "id": "bg_combat_dungeon",
  "category": "backgrounds",
  "subcategory": "combat",
  "filename": "dungeon.png",
  ...
}
```

### UI

No UI changes in this CR. Backgrounds are generated and saved to disk. Wiring them into the actual game screens (CombatScene, CardApp, RoomSelection, etc.) is a separate CR.

### System Interactions

- **Reads**: `sprite-gen/arcane-prompts.json` (background entries), `.env` (API key)
- **Writes**: `sprite-gen/output/backgrounds/*.png` (raw), `public/assets/backgrounds/{subcategory}/*.png` (final), `sprite-gen/sprite-registry.json`
- **External**: OpenRouter API (6 API calls, ~$0.24 at $0.04/image)
- **Dependencies**: `sharp` (already installed via CR-14), `dotenv` (already installed)
- **Uses**: `sprite-gen/generate-arcane-sprites.mjs` (created in CR-14), `sprite-gen/lib/post-process.mjs` (created in CR-14)

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|------------------|
| NB1 generates landscape instead of portrait | `cropToPortrait()` crops from center to 9:20 aspect ratio — verify important content is preserved |
| NB1 generates square image | `cropToPortrait()` crops width from center; results may need wider prompt (add "tall narrow scene" to prompt) |
| Background too dark (can't see anything) | Regenerate with `--force --id bg_xxx`, adjust prompt to add "dimly lit with visible details" or "torch-lit" |
| Background too bright/washed out | Regenerate with adjusted prompt: add "dark atmospheric" or "moody lighting" |
| Style inconsistency between backgrounds | Regenerate the outlier with `--force --id bg_xxx`; all prompts share the same style suffix for consistency |
| Combat bg has no clear ground plane | Regenerate with emphasis: "flat ground plane at vertical center for enemy to stand on" — this is critical for enemy placement |
| Title bg has no dark area for text | Regenerate with emphasis: "dark lower half for UI readability, large empty negative space" |
| Room selection bg doesn't show 3 paths | Regenerate with emphasis: "three distinct archways or doorways, roughly symmetrical" |
| Portrait crop loses important content (e.g., campfire cut off) | Adjust crop offset: shift `top` parameter to keep focal content; alternatively, regenerate with "centered composition" |
| API returns non-pixel-art style | All prompts include "pixel art, 32-bit era JRPG style, hand-pixeled, no blur, no photorealism" — if still wrong, add "retro game sprite" and regenerate |
| Generated image has watermark or text artifacts | Regenerate — NB1 occasionally adds text; the "no text, no watermark" suffix can help |
| Rate limiting during batch of 6 | Built-in 6s delay between calls (CR-14); 6 images = ~36s minimum |
