## Still Open Questions

### Economy & Balance

**Q-E1: Mineral conversion tax** [OPEN]
When compressing 100 Dust → 1 Shard, should there be a "loss"? e.g., require 110 Dust for 1 Shard? This acts as an economy sink but might feel punishing.

**Q-E2: Rescue beacon cost** [OPEN]
How expensive should rescue beacons be? Too cheap = no risk. Too expensive = nobody uses them. Need to find the sweet spot where carrying one is a meaningful pre-dive decision.

**Q-E3: Daily deal rotating shop specifics** [OPEN]
What items appear? How often do rare items rotate in? Should there be a "pity timer" (guaranteed rare item every X days)?

**Q-E4: Knowledge Store currency** [OPEN]
The Knowledge Store uses a separate currency earned through learning milestones. How does this currency work? Per-fact? Per-branch-percentage? Per-mastery-level?

### Dive Mechanics

**Q-D1: Layer count per run** [LEANING: 5 layers in pool, 3-5 per run]
How many layers does a single run contain? Current thinking: pool of 7+ biomes, each run draws 3-5 depending on oxygen allocation. Still needs testing.

**Q-D2: Backpack starting size** [OPEN]
3x3? 4x3? 4x4? Needs prototyping to find the sweet spot where it feels tight but not unplayable.

**Q-D3: Oxygen cost per action specifics** [OPEN]
How much oxygen per block type? Per movement? Per quiz attempt? These numbers define the entire game's pacing. Need a spreadsheet/simulation.

**Q-D4: "Barely made it" mechanic** [IDEA BOX]
If you run out of oxygen within X blocks of a layer boundary, crawl out gasping but keep everything. Cinematic, but might undermine the Sacrifice system. Needs thought.

### Content & Pipeline

**Q-C1: Fact sourcing at scale** [OPEN]
How to source and curate 500+ facts with 25 distractors each efficiently? Need to build an automated pipeline. AI-assisted with minimal human review, strong verification system.

**Q-C2: Image generation pipeline for facts** [OPEN]
Every fact gets a pixel art image. How to auto-generate these at scale? Need prompt templates per category, quality checks (image doesn't reveal answer), and batch processing via ComfyUI.

**Q-C3: Distractor quality at scale** [OPEN]
25 plausible distractors per fact is critical but hard. Need a system that generates same-domain wrong answers that are plausible but clearly wrong. Domain-specific distractor templates?

### Social & Meta

**Q-S1: Guilds/clubs** [OPEN]
"The Historians" concept — groups focused on knowledge areas. Interesting but not priority. Design the social layer to accommodate later.

**Q-S2: Seasons/battle pass** [OPEN]
"Age of Dinosaurs" themed seasons with special content. Could drive engagement cadence. Worth exploring post-MVP.

**Q-S3: How to gamify fact trading between players** [OPEN]
Trading facts is confirmed, but the mechanics need design. Marketplace? Direct trade? How to prevent exploitation?

### Learning System

**Q-L1: Balance learning bonuses across topics** [OPEN]
If learning Geology gives mining bonuses, players might only study Geology. Need balanced incentives. Deferred for now — Knowledge Tree is cosmetic/social first.

**Q-L2: Pet species count at launch** [OPEN]
5-10 species? One per major knowledge category? Need to balance content creation effort with collection depth. First pet is chosen during onboarding.

### MVP

**Q-MVP1: MVP system list** [OPEN — NEEDS DISCUSSION]
Proposed MVP (in priority order):
1. Procedural mine generation (1 biome)
2. Mining controls (tap, block hardness)
3. Block types (dirt, stone, mineral, artifact)
4. Tetris backpack
5. Dust mineral collection
6. Artifact discovery + gacha reveal
7. Quiz (1 correct + 3 from ~25 pool)
8. SM-2 spaced repetition
9. Basic Knowledge Tree
10. Per-action oxygen system
11. Onboarding (crash → mine → fossil → tree)

What to cut: layers, pets, farm, premium materializer, social, hazards, multiple minerals, data discs, streaks, combat, synergies, ambient text, computer personality.
